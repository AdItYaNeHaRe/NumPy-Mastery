This repository contains my hands-on NumPy practice—from core array operations to advanced numerical computing essential for ML, data science, and scientific computing.

## What's Inside

### Basics
- Array creation (`np.array`, zeros, ones, arange)
- Indexing/slicing
- Broadcasting
- Universal functions (ufuncs)

### Intermediate
- Mathematical operations (linear algebra, statistics, random module)
- Array manipulations (reshape, transpose, stack)
- Vectorized operations vs loops

### Advanced
- Memory optimization (views vs copies)
- Advanced indexing (boolean, fancy)
- Linear algebra (matrix operations, eigenvalues)
- FFT transforms
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration with Pandas/Scikit-learn

├── anaconda_projects/ # Anaconda project management files
│ └── db/ # Database files for project browser
└── README.md # This file

## Key Topics Covered
- **Array Creation & Attributes**: `dtype`, shape, size, memory management
- **2D Arrays (Matrices)**: Matrix operations, row/column indexing
- **Reshaping**: `reshape()`, `flatten()`, `ravel()` (MNIST examples)
- **Indexing/Slicing**: Fancy, boolean, advanced patterns
- **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: 3D tensors, axis operations, RGB images
- **Vectorization**: Broadcasting, performance comparisons (gradient descent)
- **Math Functions**: Aggregations, power/root, log/exp functions

## Educational Approach
Bilingual explanations (English + Hinglish) with:
- "What it does" + "Why it's useful"
- Parameters, return values
- ML/data science use cases
- Practical examples with outputs
- Performance best practices

## How to Use
1. Clone: `git clone "https://github.com/AdItYaNeHaRe/NumPy-Mastery"`
2. Install: `pip install numpy jupyter`
3. Open: `jupyter notebook Numpy.ipynb`
4. Run cells sequentially and experiment!

## Target Audience
